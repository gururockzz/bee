The sides of the frames are reversed, and the extractor is worked again. Extracted honey is filtered through muslin cloth."

Nectar contains 20 to 40 percent sucrose. The enzyme invertase, present in nectar and saliva of honeybees, converts sucrose into dextrose (glucose) and levulose (fructose). Honey ripening occurs through the action of enzymes and water evaporation, facilitated by the bees' wing fanning. When the water content is reduced to about 20 percent, bees seal the cell with a wax capping, indicating the honey is ripe and resistant to fermentation."
